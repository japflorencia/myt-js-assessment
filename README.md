# A test-driven JS assessment

This repo includes a set of tests that can be used to assess the skills of
a candidate for a JavaScript position.

Sometimes these tests are done while pressed on time, in such case you should prioritize some parts that are considered more important. Below are some test suites that you do _not_ have to prioritize. If you're pressed on time, please skip the following parts.

_Not so important test suites (`file.js`)_

- `app/count.js`
- `app/numbers.js`

_Not so important individual tests (`file.js #test, #anotherTest`)_

- `app/arrays.js #square, #findAllOccurrences`
- `app/async.js #manipulateRemoteData`
- `app/functions.js #partial, #callIt, #partialUsingArguments, #curryIt`
- `app/recursion.js #permute, #fibonacci, #validParentheses`
- `app/regex.js #captureThreeNumbers, #matchesPattern, #isUSD`
- `app/strings.js #wordWrap, #reverseString`

## Before starting

To begin the exercises, fork this repository on your own github account, then clone it to your local machine. When you've completed the exercises, simply download a ZIP of your solutions and send it via e-mail to your contact. Please do _not_ submit a public pull request, as other candidates will have access to these.

When working with these tests, you may not alter the tests themselves. The test suite is constructed so that it will invoke your methods and test their functionality, there is no need to change the tests, only your methods. In other words, please do not make updates in `tests/app/*`, only use these files as reference and instructions to your task.

## I want to work on the tests; what do I do?
To use the tests, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](https://nodejs.org/download/) or using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) if you are on a Mac.

Note that on Windows, there are some reports that you will need to restart
after installing Node - see #12.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    npm test

The command line runner is a work in progress; contributions welcome :)

You can also develop with live-reload and grunt-watch if that's your thing:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    grunt develop

## How to work with these tasks

One way of working with these exercises is to open up the `app/<filename-a>.js`, and the `tests/app/<filename-a>.js`. By reading the test written in the `tests/..` folder and the comments in the `app/..` folder, you will be able to understand what is expected of you in order to solve each test.

Having a split screen text editor can greatly help like shown below.

After completing all tasks, `localhost:4444` should only show green test cases.

## I need help!
